# mowbrays
The greatest house at Upper Canada College

## Here's how it do

IN THEORY you should be able to set up the site yourself with a few modifications to `_config.yml`.

- `baseurl` will change the directory that the site lives in (right now it's [obrien.tech/mowbrays](https://obrien.tech/mowbrays)).
- `description` is used for metadata and some low key parts of the site.
- `email` should be the email of the person maintaining the site (at the moment it's me/Nick O'Brien).
- `title` if you couldn't guess it's the title for the website. Just leave it as Mowbray's. Short, sweet, and to the point.

## I will be adding content to this continuously (that should be the right spelling...)

BUT I NEED HELP I CAN'T WRITE EVERYTHING I HAVE SCHOOL. Email me if you want to help

## Pictures

I need people to take pictures of Mowbray's events and send them to me for the site. I don't own any of these photos but it's for the boys so don't even worry about it.
